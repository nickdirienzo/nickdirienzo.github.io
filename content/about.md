Currently, I'm building something new with the one and only [Ross Lazerowitz](https://rosslazer.com/).

I like to build software that makes the world a little bit better.

And I love swinging on the [Engineer/Manager Pendulum](https://charity.wtf/2017/05/11/the-engineer-manager-pendulum/).

Over my career, I've been lucky to work at a variety of companies and grow as an engineer/manager/person. [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/nickdirienzo/) has more details if you're interested.
